        <li>Following are the advantages of Bootstrap:<br><br>

           - Bootstrap is Easy to Use: Bootstrap is very easy and quite simple to use for designing and development. Being a new framework there is a lot to learn from it. It can be used with CSS, LESS or SaaS etc.<br>
            
           - An Alliance is Quite Easy: Bootstrap is a framework which is easily integrated with bulk frameworks uninterrupted with existing sites or the new one.<br>
            
           -Fast and Time-Saving Framework: Bootstrap is an agile framework which is quite faster than other frameworks. It saves time due to its standard ready-made coding blocks, responsiveness, and cross-browser capabilities.<br>
            
          - Reinforcement of Grids: One more recommendable feature is that bootstrap holds 12 column grid styles and supports responsiveness, counterbalance, and embedded elements.<br>
            
           - Adhere to Basics: Bootstrap is a framework which holds base styling HTML elements like, tables, typography, buttons, forms, images, lists, and icons etc.<br>
            
           - A Pack of JavaScript Fundamentals: Bootstrap supports Javascript Components so one don't require knowledge of scripting. It comprises JavaScript components like, tooltips, modal windows, alerts etc. to add functionalities easily.<br>
            
           - Support is Amazing: Bootstrap is well-known for its big support community and agile response or online solution for the problems or queries. It also offers a great documentation along with examples and demo. It provides solutions to freshers and veterans alike.<br>
            
           - Bootstrap is totally Customizable: It is developer friendly and can be customized as per the project requirements. Common CSS, utilities, Javascript Components, and components can compose the appearance to create ease for developers.<br>
            
            -Agile Responsive: Bootstrap is a fully responsive platform supporting fluid grid layout. It crafts a mobile ready site smoothly and easily and sets web design as per the dimensions of the particular device.<br>
            
           - Bootstrap's Consistency: Websites or mobile applications made with bootstrap technology can make you feel the awesome pairing of developers and designers ensuring consistency.<br>
            
            -Frequent Updates: It provides regular updates and makes the whole eco-system hefty and robust according to the time.</li><br><br><br>

            <li>In Bootstrap, container is used to set the content's margins dealing with the responsive behaviors of your layout. <br>It contains the row elements and the row elements are the container of columns (known as grid system). The container class is used to create boxed content.<br>
               It does work :Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system.<br> -Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them.<br> -While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

              <br><br> Bootstrap comes with three different containers:<br><br>
               
               .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint<br>
               .container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints<br>
               .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint</li><br><br><br>

               <li>The default Bootstrap text settings are as follows:-<br><br>
                1>Text alignment:
                Easily realign text to components with text alignment classes. For start, end, and center alignment, responsive classes are available that use the same viewport width breakpoints as the grid system.
               <br> -Start aligned text on all viewport sizes.

               
               <br> -Center aligned text on all viewport sizes.

               <br> -End aligned text on all viewport sizes.

               <br> -Start aligned text on viewports sized SM (small) or wider.

               <br>-Start aligned text on viewports sized MD (medium) or wider.

               <br>-Start aligned text on viewports sized LG (large) or wider.

               <br>-Start aligned text on viewports sized XL (extra-large) or wider.<br><br>

               2>Text wrapping and overflow: Wrap text with a .text-wrap class.<br><br>

               3>Word break:
               Prevent long strings of text from breaking your components' layout by using .text-break to set word-wrap: break-word and word-break: break-word. We use word-wrap instead of the more common overflow-wrap for wider browser support, and add the deprecated word-break: break-word to avoid issues with flex containers.<br>

               4>Text transform:<br><br>
               Transform text in components with text capitalization classes.<br>
               
               -lowercased text.<br>
               
               - UPPERCASED TEXT.<br>
               
               -CapiTaliZed Text.<br><br>

               5>Font size:Quickly change the font-size of text. While our heading classes (e.g., .h1–.h6) apply font-size, font-weight, and line-height, these utilities only apply font-size. Sizing for these utilities matches HTML’s heading elements, so as the number increases, their size decreases.<br><br>

               6>Font weight and italics:
        
               Quickly change the font-weight or font-style of text with these utilities. font-style utilities are abbreviated as .fst-* and font-weight utilities are abbreviated as .fw-*.<br><br>

               7>Line height:
               Change the line height with .lh-* utilities.<br><br>

               8>Monospace:
               Change a selection to our monospace font stack with .font-monospace.<br><br>

               9>Reset color:
               Reset a text or link’s color with .text-reset, so that it inherits the color from its parent.<br><br>

               10>Text decoration:
               Decorate text in components with text decoration classes.
               
               This text has a line underneath it.<br><br>

               11>Sass:Variables e.g.// stylelint-disable value-keyword-case,// stylelint-enable value-keyword-case,// $font-size-root affects the value of `rem`, which is used for as well font sizes, paddings, and margins
               // $font-size-base affects the font size of the body text.<br><br>

               12>Maps:
               Font-size utilities are generated from this map, in combination with our utilities API.<br><br>

               13>Utilities API:
               Font and text utilities are declared in our utilities API in scss/_utilities.scss.etc.<br><br><br>
                   
              

               <li>Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It's built with flexbox and is fully responsive.<br>
               <br> -Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.<br>

                -If you do not want to use all 12 column individually, you can group the columns together to create wider columns 
            <br>-Bootstrap's grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange depending on the screen size: On a big screen it might look better with the content organized in three columns, but on a small screen it would be better if the content items were stacked on top of each other.<br>
            <br><br>-The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:<br>

            <br>->xs (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)
            <br> ->sm (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)
            <br> ->md (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)
            <br>->lg (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide)</li><br><br><br>

            <li>The difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 are as follows:<br><br>
               
                -> BOOTSTRAP 4:<br><br>
                -It has 5 tier (xs, sm, md, lg, xl).<br>
                -It has limited colors.<br>
                -It has jquery and all related plugins.<br>
                -Bootstrap 4 supports both IE 10 and 11.<br>
                -Radio buttons, checkboxes have different look in different OS and browsers. The form uses whatever default browsers provide.<br>
                -We cannot modify utilities in bootstrap 4<br>
                -We use .glutter with fontsize in px<br>
                -Columns can be positioned relative<br>
                -Bootstrap 4 doesn’t have its own SVG icons, we have to use font-awesome for icons.<br>
                -It supports Jumbotron.<br>
                -The card deck is used to create a set of cards with equal width and height.<br>
                -We have inline-block property and we will get white dropdown as default for dropdown-menu-dark class.<br>
                -Bootstrap 4 uses Jekyll software.<br>
                -This makes easier to implement vertical designs, and the columns and rows can easily be implemented. the classes justify-center-content can directly be used to align according to the requirement.<br>
                -It does not enable RTL(Right to Left) switching.<br>
                -It does not support Offcanvas Component.<br><br>

                ->BOOTSTRAP 5:<br><br>

                -It has 6 tier (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl).<br>
                -Extra colors added with the looks, A card improved color palette. there are various shades available to choose.<br>
                -Jquery is removed and switched to vanilla JS with some working plugins<br>
                -Bootstrap 5 doesn’t support IE 10 and 11.<br>
                -The look of form elements will not change, on different OS or browser. The forms can be customized and form controls can be added, they would not depend on browser.<br> 
                -Bootstrap 5 gave freedom to modify and also create our own utility<br>
                -We use .g* with fontsize in rem<br>
                -Columns cannot be positioned relative<br>
                -Bootstrap 5 have its own SVG icons<br>
                -It doesn’t support jumbotron.<br>
                -Card deck class in removed in bootstrap<br>
                -Inline-block property is removed and we will get black dropdown as default for dropdown-menu-dark class<br>
                -Bootstrap 5 uses Hugo software as it is fast static site generator.<br>
                -advanced grid system is made available , also columns don’t have relative positions.<br>
                - It enables RTL(Right to Left) switching.<br>
                -It supports Offcanvas Component(that is it is available now).</li><br><br>

                <li>A button group is a container control that holds push button controls. The button group defines the layout for the buttons it contains, including alignment within the container and the title for the group. Place this control within a section control or a table control.<br>
                    Button groups allow multiple buttons to be stacked together on a single line. This is useful when you want to place items like alignment buttons together. You can add on optional JavaScript radio and checkbox style behavior with Bootstrap Button Plugin. This class is used for a basic button group.<br>
                  <br>-The three main classes that are used to create a button group are <br>
                  -the btn-group class, <br>
                  -. btn class and<br> 
                  - one of the contextual classes (. btn-*).
                </li><br><br>

                <li>you can use Bootstrap to make thumbnails in as follow ways:<br><br>

                    -Add an <a> tag with the class of .thumbnail around an image.<br>


                    - This adds four pixels of padding and a gray border.<br>

                        
                    -On hover, an animated glow outlines the image.
                </li><br><br><br>


                <li>In Bootstrap 4, flex box is used to control the layout and alignment specification of Bootstrap 4 components.<br>
                   -This box makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structures without using float or positioning attributes.<br>
                   -It's important to understand that Bootstrap 4's grid system is built with Flexbox. What sets Bootstrap apart from using Flexbox alone is the process of writing code. <br>
                   -With Bootstrap, you can create a grid using only HTML.</li><br><br>

                   <li>Bootstrap provides an easy way to create alert messages:<br>

                    -Success! This alert box indicates a successful or positive action.<br>
                    -Info! This alert box indicates a neutral informative change or action.<br>
                    -Warning! This alert box indicates a warning that might need attention.<br>
                    -Danger! This alert box indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action.<br>
                    -Alerts are created with the .alert class, followed by one of the four contextual classes .alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning or .alert-danger:<br><br>

                   1> Alert Links:
                      Add the alert-link class to any links inside the alert box to create "matching colored links":<br>
                    
                    -Success! You should read this message.
                    -Info! You should read this message.
                    -Warning! You should read this message.
                    -Danger! You should read this message.<br><br>
                    
                    2>Closing Alerts:<br>
                      -Click on the "x" symbol to the right to close me.<br>
                      -To close the alert message, add a .alert-dismissible class to the alert container. Then add class="close" and data-dismiss="alert" to a link or a button element (when you click on this the alert box will disappear).<br><br>

3>Animated Alerts:<br>
-Click on the "x" symbol to the right to close me. I will "fade" out.
-The .fade and .in classes adds a fading effect when closing the alert message:,etc. </li><br><br>



<li>In its simplest form, a Bootstrap card is a . card class with the . card-body class nested inside. This creates a card with a rounded border inside which you can place text, images, links, and other Bootstrap elements.<br>
   - Add the .card class to a div (<>) element and inside the div element, add another div element with the .card-body class to create a basic Bootstrap card. You can add text inside the inner div element. This is the most basic card that you can create, and it is a body-only card.Add the .card class to a div element and inside the div element, add another div element with the .card-body class to create a basic Bootstrap card. You can add text inside the inner div element. This is the most basic card that you can create, and it is a body-only card.<br>

    -You can also have the options to add headers, footers, images, etc. to the cards.<br>
